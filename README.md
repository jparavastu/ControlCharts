Control charts, also known as Shewhart charts (after Walter A. Shewhart) or process-behavior charts, are a statistical process control tool used to determine if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of control.

$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.11:1.5.0

#### Spark compiled with Scala 2.10:

$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.10:1.5.0
